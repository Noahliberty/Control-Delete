# Control-Delete - A HS assessment.

Hi,

Welcome to my repo

This app is a Node.js app using HTML, CSS, & JS. I used Semantic UI to style. I also used git(obviously haha) & Heroku to Deploy.

It utilizes the "Hubspot Forms API" to collect information from a sign up and deliver the information to the Hubspot CRM via API in JSON format. It also includes a Hubspot tracking code.
